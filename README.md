Given a JPEG image, the program finds the edges of the document or receipt and displays a scanned version with OpenCv. The program also automatically creates a PDF file with the same name as the JPEG image with the scanned document. Utilizes the Open CV library.

Note: Will run on Python 3+ and OpenCV 3+
